    "and planted it with choice vines;\n",
    "he built a watchtower in the midst of it,\n",
    "and hewed out a wine vat in it;\n",
    "and he looked for it to yield grapes,\n",
    "but it yielded wild grapes.\n",
    "\n",

    "judge between me and my vineyard.\n",
    "4What more was there to do for my vineyard,\n",
    "that I have not done in it?\n",
    "When I looked for it to yield grapes,\n",
    "why did it yield wild grapes?\n",

    "5And now I will tell you\n",
    "what I will do to my vineyard.\n",
    "I will remove its hedge,\n",
    "and it shall be devoured;a\n",
    "I will break down its wall,\n",
    "and it shall be trampled down.\n",
    "6I will make it a waste;\n",
    "it shall not be pruned or hoed,\n",
    "and briers and thorns shall grow up;\n",
    "I will also command the clouds\n",
    "that they rain no rain upon it.\n",
    "\n",
    "7For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts\n",
    "is the house of Israel,\n",
    "and the men of Judah\n",

    "14Therefore Sheol has enlarged its appetite\n",

Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? 14Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.h 15He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good. 16For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted. 17The Lord will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father’s house such days as have not come since the day that Ephraim departed from Judah—the king of Assyria!”\n",
