For Job said, “It may be that my children have sinned, and curseda God in their hearts.” Thus Job did continually.\n",

You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. 11But stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face.” 12And the Lord said to Satan, “Behold, all that he has is in your hand.
